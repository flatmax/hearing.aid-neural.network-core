Abstract:

The definition of a hearing aid core which is based on a prescription neural network (such as NAL-NL2) is defined here. This hearing aid core replaces a traditional compressor hearing aid core which mimics the said hearing aid prescription. Whilst the replacement of the compressors for a neural network may seem simple, the implications are vast in terms of the “learning prescription” where the topology of the neural network may be increased to make available more free parameters and allow great personalisation of the hearing aid prescription.
